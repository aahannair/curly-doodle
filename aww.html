	<h1> This Is What A Story Should Look Like</h1>
	<h4>Harry Potter In the past couple years, there has been a growing phenomenon in the world of children's literature, this phenomenon is Harry Potter. J.K. Rowlings series of novels about a young wizard and his years at "Hogwarts School of Wizarding and Witchcraft," has become one of the most successful children's book series of all time. Before reading any of the now four novels, one may find it hard to believe that a children's novel may be so entertaining. But once one starts reading any of the four books, it is plain to see why these books are so popular.

Before first reading a Harry Potter novel, I was skeptical that a children's book about an orphan wizard going to school would be entertaining. 

Whether it is a fight for his life, winning a quidditch match, or just staying out of trouble, these novels are anything but boring. This I believe, is one of the biggest reasons why these books have been such a success, the author knows how to keep the story going at all times in order to maintain the readers attention. Another factor which I believe has led to the novels success is that while reading, the reader wishes that they could live in this fantasy world created by Rowling where life is anything but ordinary. The novels make the reader somewhat desire a life like the one led by the characters of the novels, like going to a school to learn wizarding, always having extraordinary things happen and just being at Hogwarts seems like an unequaled joy for some. These novels have the ability to reignite the long lost imaginations of adults, and keep the imaginations of children strong. 

Although I am a strong supporter of this book series, I do find one thing wrong with the books. All the novels have endings which are almost the same, Harry saves the day and Voldemort the major antagonist gets defeated in one way or another.
